# ♟️ Chess AI Bot

A custom chess AI powered by a convolutional neural network, trained on **~100M chess positions** from Stockfish self-play and public datasets from Lichess.  
The model reaches an estimated **~1100 Elo** (16% win-rate vs Stockfish-3 at Elo 1320) and is playable via a full-stack **React + Flask web app** in real time, complete with a virtual board visualisation, the ability to start a game as black or white, and game move history.

## 🎯 Motivation
I built this project to deepen my understanding of **machine learning, reinforcement learning, and game theory**.  
Since I’m interested in strategy games, creating a chess AI from scratch allowed me to combine theory with a practical, challenging application and deploy it as a playable web app.

## ⚡ Features

**AI / Training**
- Residual CNN policy + value network suitable for chess move prediction and outcome estimation.
- Trains from chunked NumPy datasets (`positions*.npy`, `moves*.npy`, `values*.npy`) produced by encoder scripts.
- Uses Stockfish evaluations as value labels for supervised training.
- Memory-mapped dataset loader with an LRU cache for efficient training on large corpora.
- Checkpointing, resume training, TensorBoard logging.

**Web App**
- React frontend with an interactive chessboard and move validation.
- Flask backend hosting the model for inference (PyTorch).
- Full move history, New Game options (choose color), and clean UI.
- Dockerised for reproducible deployment.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
**AI / ML**: PyTorch, python-chess, Stockfish, NumPy, Python  
**Backend**: Flask (Python)  
**Frontend**: React, Chessboard.js  
**Deployment**: Docker

## 🚀 Quickstart (Run Locally)

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-ai-bot.git
cd chess-ai-bot
```

### Recommended: Docker

```bash
docker build -t chess-ai-bot .
docker run -p 5001:5000 chess-ai-bot
```

➡️ The app will be available at:  
👉 http://localhost:5001

### Without Docker (venv)

**Backend**
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

**Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

---

## 📦 Model Export (Reduce Checkpoint Size)

Training produces large checkpoints (`last.pt`, often hundreds of MB).  
For deployment, convert them to a smaller `model.pth`:

```bash
python ChessAIBot_ExportModel.py --checkpoint savedModels/last.pt --output model.pth
```

---

## 🔌 API Reference

The Flask backend exposes simple endpoints:

- `POST /predict`  
  Input: JSON with FEN (chess position).  
  Output: Predicted best move(s) + value evaluation.  

- `GET /health`  
  Returns `200 OK` if the model is loaded.

## 🧠 Model & Training Summary

- **Architecture:** Convolutional Residual Network (8 residual blocks, policy + value heads).  
- **Dataset:** ~100M chess positions (Stockfish self-play + public games).  
- **Training:** Supervised learning on move labels + outcome prediction.  
- **RL Concepts:** Incorporated reinforcement learning concepts for self-play decision making.  
- **Export:** Checkpoints (`last.pt`) converted into smaller `model.pth` for deployment.

---

## 🔁 Reproducibility & Scripts

To reproduce training:

```bash
python train.py --dataset path/to/data --epochs 10 --batch-size 256
```

> ⚠️ Training from scratch requires significant compute (GPU recommended).  
> Alternatively, you can use the provided `last.pt` checkpoint and export to `model.pth`.
